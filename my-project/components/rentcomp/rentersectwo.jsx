            Both landlords and tenants can avoid potential problems by having a
            well-drafted lease agreement that enumerates all rental terms. We
            discuss the particulars of a property and its occupancy and ensure
            that your lease covers all aspects of your rental agreement. We want
            you to feel confident that the agreement you sign is in compliance
            with California law and that your rights are protected should a
            dispute arise.

            California law specifies the usage, retention and return of security
            deposits paid by tenants. If your landlord fails to follow these
            regulations, we can help you collect what is due to you. We first
            pursue the most cost-effective route of obtaining payment from your
            landlord but will assertively defend your rights in court when
            necessary.

            Eviction is disruptive to both the landlord and the tenant.

            when eviction is undesirable. If you are a tenant who unfairly faces
            eviction, we will protect your right to remain in your home.
